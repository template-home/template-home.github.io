# The Template Manifesto

Start a project from scratch although important for learning purposes it is not a must when we need to quickly start a project.

## The goal

To find, list and advertise templates and boilerplates for software projects.

### Find

There is no specific search for templates in github, so the best way of doing it is search for well know keywords and look for the most used or starred projects.

Even filtering out, sometimes the number of results makes impossible to check every result. If you think there is some great template you know please let us know by sending a email: <jose.eduardo.mco@gmail.com>

### List

Simply projects linking to their respectives repos helps litle to promote their jobs. 

So we've fork the repos to add good keywords, good info, good readmes and push it back to the original repos.

### Advertise

We hope to extend this blog and create other ways to advertise this list of projects. If you have any idea keep in touch!

## Credits 

All projects are a colletive work and its crucial to give credit to all contributors even the indirect ones.
