## About 

Behind every github repository there is an idea that should be shared but sometimes is not easy to explain it. This repository serves as a super generic template so you can explain your ideas.

It uses format ideas from several great github projects, like using badges to comunicate project status, the use of single line indexes, images, animations and emoticons!
	
## Features

Some projects might have several resources (documents, images, code...) so it is important to present this in a simple list. 

This template contains the following features:

- This `readme` file that serves as simple and padronized way of explain your projects.

- A `LICENSE` file example to explain others how they can use the project.
